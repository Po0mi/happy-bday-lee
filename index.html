      <p>Happy Birthday, Lee!</p>
      <p>I know we got off to a rough start, but forget about that—hahaha! Right now, all that matters is your birthday. I know you don’t like birthdays because they remind you of getting older, but so what? DON’T WORRY ABOUT THAT! Just focus on the present and enjoy your life. You have so much to live for instead of worrying about that.</p>
      <p>As for me, I’m sorry if I ever come off as boring or if I cause any problems for you. I know I’m not perfect, and I have my own struggles, but I want you to know that I truly care about you. All that matters to me is your happiness. You’ve been through a lot, and I’m genuinely proud of how far you’ve come. You don’t have to rush things, just enjoy life as it is. Life can be full of ups and downs, and that’s okay, it’s all part of the journey. Just remember, you’re not alone. I’m here, always</p>
      <p>I’m not really sure what else to say in this letter—hahaha! But I just want to tell you that I enjoy spending time with you. I know sometimes we don’t do much, but I’m trying my best to make you feel happy and understood. Every moment with you, no matter how small, feels meaningful to me. Whether we’re laughing together, sharing quiet moments, or just being ourselves, I cherish every second. I’m doing this because I want you to be happy, to feel seen, and to feel appreciated. You don’t have to do anything in return, and that’s perfectly okay with me. It’s always been that way, and it's okay.</p>
      <p>On your special day, I hope you feel loved and appreciated—not just by me, but by everyone who knows you. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I’m so grateful to meet you and I can’t thank you enough for that.</p>
      <p>I hope this year brings you everything you’ve been dreaming of and more. May it be filled with laughter, love, and all the little things that make you smile. You’re a wonderful person and I’m lucky to know you. I hope you realize how much you mean to me and to everyone around you. Once again Happy Birthday Lee.</p>
